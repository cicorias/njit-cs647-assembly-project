//./retAddr3 $(perl -e 'print "A"x50') 


//This program is extremely similar to retAddr2.

//You do not have the full source code for this one but there is a function which seems to be insecure and it looks like this:

// return address; 0x080487da -- needs to be  0x08048805 / 0x08048805 or 0x08048802


	void function (char a, char b, char c, char * input)
	{
		int x = 10;
		short y = 24;
		char buffer[20] = {'\0'};
		char buffer2[16] = {'\0'};
		char buffer3[8] = {'\0'};

		strcpy(buffer2, input);
	}


//Below you can see most of the source code for the main function. If you can manage to get the program to print "::: You Win :::", you will also get the password to the next level.

	void main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
		int x;

		x = 0;
		function(1,2,3,argv[1]);
		x = 1;

		if (x == 0)
			printf("::: You lose :::\n");
		else if (x == 2){
			printf("::: You Win :::\n");
			//levelTwo()??
		}
		else
			printf("::: You lose :::\n");
	}


//I hope that helps! Good luck!
